#Project:
#Codenames. The board game taking the world by storm. However, some people are bad at it. Well, fear not, we're going to build a bot for that!
#Codenames is a game where there are 25 tiles on a board each with a given word. Some of the tiles belong to the red team, some to the blue #team. The goal of the game is to provide a clue word that relates to your team's tiles so that your teammate may correctly identify which #tiles are yours (of course, you cannot provide the tile's word as a clue). It's tricky because you are trying to correctly identify as many #tiles as possible with a single word. For example if you have the tiles "cold," "baseball," and "alcohol," you might say "beer, 3" indicating #that "beer" is a related word to 3 words on the board. The purpose of this bot is to aid in-game play by taking the clue word as input and #outputting a list of available words on the board ranked by similarity to the clue.

#Tech stack:
#I will predominantly use Google Colab, Python and Word2Vec.
